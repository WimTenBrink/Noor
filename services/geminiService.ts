**Primary Directive:** The song's narrative, story, and core subject matter MUST be derived exclusively from the "Song's Theme" provided below. The musical style, instruments, and other qualities are for tonal and structural guidance only; they should influence the *feeling* and *rhythm* of the lyrics, but **not** the story itself. For example, if the style is 'Merfolk/Siren' but the topic is 'a robot finding a friend', the lyrics must be about the robot, with a haunting or alluring *tone*, not about the sea.

${ratingInstruction}

${performerInstruction}
${languageInstruction}
${relationshipInstruction}

The song should be written in the *tonal spirit* of: ${style}.
The song's *rhythmic feel* should be compatible with: ${instruments.join(', ')}.

The song's theme, which dictates the story, is based on this:
---
${topic || "An uplifting song about friendship and creativity."}
---
Also, consider these qualities for the song's overall feel:
- Narrative Dynamic: ${narrativeDynamic || 'Not specified'}
- Mood: ${mood || 'Not specified'}
- Genre Context: ${genre || 'Not specified'}
- Pace: ${pace || 'Not specified'}
- Texture: ${instrumentation || 'Not specified'}
- Lyrical Theme: ${lyricalTheme || 'Not specified'}
- Vocal Style: ${vocalStyle || 'Not specified'}
- Drum Style: ${drumStyle || 'Not specified'}
- Snare Sound: ${snareType || 'Not specified'}
- Special Instrument Feature: ${specialInstrument || 'Not specified'}
These should influence the lyrical tone, the structure, and the performance directions you provide in brackets.

Your task is to generate a suitable song title and the full song lyrics. To ensure the song fits within typical generation limits (around 2-3 minutes including instrumentals), please create a concise song structure.
For example, a good structure would be: [Intro], [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Verse 2], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Solo], [Chorus], [Outro].
Avoid overly long verses or too many repeating sections.

**Crucial First Step:** Before any other content, the VERY FIRST lines of the generated lyrics MUST be the introductions for all singers, each on a new line, exactly as specified below:
${singerIntroductions}
    
Follow these strict formatting rules for Suno AI:
- Use tags like [Intro], [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro], etc., to structure the song.
- Indicate non-lyrical vocalizations like (oohs), (aahs).
- Use [Spoken Word] for spoken parts.
- Use *sound effect* for sound effects, like *thunder clap*.
- ${singers.length > 1 ? `Clearly label parts for each singer or group (e.g., ${singerLabels.join(', ')}, [Duet], [Choir]).` : `Label the singer part as ${singerLabels[0]}.`}
    
**Critically Important:** All musical or performance instructions MUST be enclosed in \`[]\` brackets. Do NOT write descriptive sentences about the music within the lyrics, such as 'The guitar comes in here'. Instead, use bracketed tags like \`[Acoustic guitar intro]\` or \`[Music fades out]\`. The lyrics should only contain the words to be sung and the bracketed instructions.

Output a JSON object with two keys: "title" and "lyrics". The title must be in ${language}. The lyrics must follow the language instructions provided above.
Do not include any other text or explanation outside of the JSON object.`;

${characterContext || 'No specific character context provided.'}
- General Theme: The artists explore themes of love, connection, and identity from a female perspective, often with a subtle sapphic sensibility. Their relationships (Miranda/Annelies are a couple) should inform the tone of their personal notes.

**Instructions:**
Your response must be structured in two distinct parts: "The Story" and "Personal Notes".

**Part 1: The Story**

1.  **Fictional Origin Story:**
    - As a creative writer, invent a compelling, fictional origin story for the song. This should be a small adventure or a moment of sudden inspiration.
    - **CRITICAL:** This story **MUST** be written as three or more distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph should be separated by a newline. Do not merge them into a single block of text. For example:
      Paragraph 1...
      
      Paragraph 2...
      
      Paragraph 3...
    - The story should be engaging and weave in elements from the song's theme and lyrics.

2.  **The Song's Message:**
    - Immediately after the story, write a new, separate paragraph that explains the core message of the song in simple, plain language. This paragraph should start with something like "At its heart, the song is about..."

**Part 2: Personal Notes**

1.  **Singer Reflections:**
    - After explaining the message, create the following sections, each with a short, heartfelt note from the singer's perspective.
    ${personalNotesInstructions.join('\n')}
    - In each note, the singer should reflect on the fictional origin story you created and their personal connection to the song's message.

**Output Format:**
- Use Markdown for formatting. The personal notes must use \`## A Note from [Singer Name]\` headers.
- The entire response should be the report content. Do not add any preamble.

    const prompt = `You are an expert prompt engineer for text-to-image models like Imagen.
Your task is to create a single, detailed, high-quality image prompt for a song's cover art. The prompt must be strictly PG-rated or G-rated, ensuring it is family-friendly and safe-for-work.

**Core Theme Analysis:**
- The song's theme is: "${topic || "A group of female musicians creating music together"}".
- The music style is: ${style || "Pop"}.
- Analyze this theme. If it is clearly about people, you can describe the performers. If it is about a place, an object, or an abstract concept, focus the prompt on creating a beautiful, artistic representation of that theme.
- **Crucially, do not include people or singers in the prompt unless the theme explicitly calls for it.** For example, a song about "sunflowers in a field at sunset" should not feature any people. A song about "two friends on a road trip" should.

**Performer Details (ONLY use if the theme is about people):**
- ${subjectInstruction}
- ${descriptions}

**Instructions for the final prompt:**
- Combine all relevant elements into one cohesive, artistic scene.
- If depicting people, describe their appearances based on the descriptions, their clothing, their emotional expressions, and their interaction with each other.
- The background and environment of the image must subtly reflect the core theme and musical style.
- Use descriptive keywords that text-to-image models understand well:
    - For Composition: cinematic, dynamic angle, rule of thirds, photorealistic, 8k, hyper-detailed, intricate, sharp focus.
    - For Lighting: soft lighting, dramatic lighting, neon glow, golden hour, Rembrandt lighting.
    - For Mood: ethereal, energetic, melancholic, joyful, mysterious.

Output only the final prompt as a single line of text. Do not include any other explanations.`;
