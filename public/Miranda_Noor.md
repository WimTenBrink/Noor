## Backstory

Miranda Noor was born on January 1, 2007, in New York City, holding an American passport from birth. Her identity was shaped by her Brit-Indian father and Dutch mother. Tragically, her father died in a car crash when she was two, leading her heartbroken mother to move them to her small hometown in the Netherlands.

Growing up in the Netherlands, Miranda navigated a complex identity, feeling 'different' as a girl with three passports and two languages. She learned to embrace this complexity as a source of resilience, empathy, and a strong voice.

During high school, she met Annelies Brink at a poetry slam, finding an immediate and profound connection that made her world feel whole. Annelies, a poet rooted in Dutch soil, complemented Mirandaâ€™s narrative style, and together they formed the band 'Noor'.

Her life is dedicated to creativity, expressed through singing (inspired by Joni Mitchell), storytelling, and writing. Living on their farm, surrounded by animals, she feels a deep connection to the earth, which grounds her life and art.

## Notes

Miranda is passionate about channeling her experiences into advocacy, standing with the LGBTQ+ community, and championing female rights and the visibility of mixed-race identities.

She is currently navigating the exciting and often daunting transition into full adulthood, contemplating a first car and making long-term decisions about her future.

Her life is a testament to the connections that hold people together, rich with love, humor, and purpose.
