Last Updated: {day} {month} {year}

Welcome to the Miranda Noor Lyric & Art Generator! This application is a creative tool designed by Miranda Noor and Annelies Brink for musicians and creators.

## 1. Description of Service

This application ("the Service") allows users to:
- Generate song lyrics, including instrumental cues, using Google's Gemini AI model.
- Generate album cover art using Google's Imagen AI model.

The Service acts as an interface to Google's AI services. It does not store your generated content on our servers.

## 2. API Key and Data Usage

To function, this application requires you to provide your own Google AI API Key.

- **API Key:** Your key is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. It is required for all AI generation features and is sent directly from your browser to the Google AI API with each request. It is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.
- **Input Prompts:** The text and parameters you enter to generate lyrics and images are sent directly to the Google AI API.
- **Generated Content:** The lyrics and images generated are returned from the Google AI API directly to your browser.
- **Logging:** The application features a client-side console that logs your requests and Google's responses. This data stays within your browser. You have the option to save these logs to your local machine. No logs are automatically transmitted or stored by us.
- **No Server-Side Storage:** We do not host, store, or view your prompts, your generated content, or any API key information.

## 3. Disclaimers

- The Service is provided "as is" without any warranties.
- The output from the AI models is generated algorithmically and may not be unique, accurate, or free from biases. You are responsible for reviewing and editing the content to suit your needs.
- We are not responsible for the content you generate or how you choose to use it. You must ensure your use of the generated content complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe on any third-party rights.
